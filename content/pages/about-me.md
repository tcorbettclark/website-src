Title: About Me
Status: published

One of my interests is Machine Learning. In particular, I’m interested in continuing the work I did some 20 years ago on extracting explanations from Artificial Neural Networks as part of my DPhil (see [Publications](/pages/publications)), before co-founding a company and leading (as CTO) the creation of enterprise software systems for collecting and cleaning data for clinical trial research in the pharmaceutical sector (see [Cmed](https://www.cmedresearch.com) and [Encapsia](https://www.encapsia.com)).

## About this blog

This blog will be a record of my thoughts, ideas, and results as they continue to develop. I’m writing it as a resource for me, but hope it is interesting to others especially now that Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science *etc* are all such popular topics.
