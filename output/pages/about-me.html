<h1>About me</h1>
<p>One of my interests is AI (who isn't?!). In particular, I’m interested in continuing the work I did some 20 years ago on extracting explanations from Artificial Neural Networks as part of my DPhil (see <a href="/pages/publications">Publications</a>), before co-founding a company and leading (as CTO) the creation of enterprise software systems for collecting and cleaning data for clinical trial research in the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
<h2>About this blog</h2>
<p>This blog will be a record of my thoughts, ideas, and results as they continue to develop. I’m writing it as a resource for me, but hope it is interesting to others especially now that Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science <em>etc</em> are all such popular topics.</p>
